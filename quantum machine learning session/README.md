# Quantum Machine Learning Session

##### This session was presented by [Kareem El-Safty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kareemelsafty/) at Alexandria Universeity at the end of the Quantum Computing Summer School.

The repo contains the presentation and also a notebook that implements the implicit approach of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07128.pdf) **"*Quantum machine learning in feature Hilbert spaces*"** by ***Maria Schuld*** & ***Nathan Killoran***.

The notebook was adpoted from the guest lectures jupyter notebooks by ***Peter Wittek*** from his famous course [QML](https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-machine-learning-2). The main repo for the course is [here](https://gitlab.com/qosf/qml-mooc)

I only **implemented** the kernel itself.

The other part of the paper will be implemented soon.

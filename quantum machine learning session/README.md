# Quantum Machine Learning Session
#### This session was presented by [Kareem El-Safty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kareemelsafty/) at Alexandria Universeity at the end of the Quantum Computing Summer School.

The repo contains the presentation and also a notebook that implements the implicit approach of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07128.pdf) by Maria Schuld & Nathan Killoran.

The notebook was adpoted from the guest lectures jupyter notebooks by Peter Wittek from his famous course [QML](https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-machine-learning-2).  

I only **implemented** the kernel itself

The other part of the paper will be implemented soon
